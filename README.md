This is a simple two-player dice game where the objective is to be the first to reach 100 points. Players take turns rolling a dice, adding the roll to their current score unless they roll a 1, which causes them to lose their current points for that turn and switch turns. Players can choose to "hold" their score, adding the current score to their total and passing the turn to the other player. The game ends when a player reaches 100 points, and they are declared the winner. You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "New Game" button.
